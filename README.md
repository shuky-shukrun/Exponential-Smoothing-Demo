# Exponential Smoothing Demo

This project demonstrate the different methods of Exponential Smoothing.
The project is our final project on 'Advanced WEB Technologies' course.

We used React, Bootstrap and Firebase (authentication and database).

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Deployment
